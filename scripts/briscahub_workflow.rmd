Here is described the script workflow that have been used for BRISCA project as a kind of log file.

This is the new 2017 workflow cause we discovered some glitch in species occ definition and almost
everithing have to be done from scratch!


## January 2017

1. Anne has corrected input data for 22 species that have fake presences (xx/01/2017)

## February 2017

1. run the Thining process for the 22 species on presences (13/02/2017)

2. generate the thined pseudo absences for our 22 species (14/02/2017)

3. do the pure climate modelling, projection and ensemble projections for our 22 species (15/02/2017 to 22/02/2017)

4. produce some graphs to check the validity of projected models and send it to Anne and Signe for a visual check (23/02/2017)

5. copy the pure climate models outputs in /data/idiv_sdiv/ (27/02/2017)

6. construct the present day filter masks (current binaries projection with convexhull + 250m buffer) (27/02/2017)

7. create biotic interaction masks
